* Add a delayed repeat function to IR and/or joystick
* Fix timer - currently broken
* GPS does not actually set the clock yet - it just runs asynchronously
* A GPS status screen (e.g. GPS time, fix status, num satellites?)
* Timezones display (possibly with left/right on the joystick/remote which is currently unused)
* Remove the alarm screen if we're not using it - perhaps with a constant
* Any further global variable tidying?
